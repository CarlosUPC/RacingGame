# RacingGame
Hi! Welcome to our racing game project!

This is a small project made it by two students from CITM-UPC videogame development grade.

We created a physics game where the main character is a car to test our knowledge with Bullet Physics library with the help of OpenGL library.

## Gameplay

It is a racing game against the clock, without walls and with a set of obstacles that make it difficult for the player to reach the finish line. The player must complete the circuit to win before the time reaches zero, otherwise he will lose the game. 

In addition, the player will find several collectible items that he can pick up which benefit from giving him more speed during the game.

There are a set of checkpoints that save the player position and he will respawn into them if it happens that he falls down from the circuit (there aren't walls!).

As a gameplay mechanic, the player will be able to jump through certain obstacles.

## Main goal of the game

Our main goal's game is complete the circuit before the timer reaches zero, otherwise he will lose the game.
